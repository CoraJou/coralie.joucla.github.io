### About us

We're an interdisciplinary team of scientists exploring system modelling and control systems approaches to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology. 

The brain is a real-time dynamical system. Yet, [clinical neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neurophysiology) (and, in truth, much of cognitive neuroscience, from event-related potentials to 3-sec fMRI slices) treats it as a static averaging machine, which behavior is analysed and diagnosed from its averaged response over trials rather than its real-time, single-trial variance.  

_Our vision is to make a control-systems revolution in human clinical neurophysiology_, with automatized stimulation techniques that are able to adapt in real time to the patient's brain dynamics in order to diagnose, prognose and treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. 

Our work is both experimental (we collect our own data, using tools borrowed from the fields of [neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neurophysiology) and [psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics)) and computational (we build our own techniques to e.g. generate experimental stimuli using [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) or analyse physiological recordings using data-driven [system modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification)). We work both with healthy participants and patients, with a strong focus in the fields of [neurology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology) and [psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry), for pathologies such as coma, stroke, autism spectrum and post-traumatic stress disorders. 

We're based in the [Department of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation), in the [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) (CNRS/Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté) in Besançon, France. 

### Research

Our current work explores two complementary lines of research

#### Neurophysiological system identification using reverse correlation

In recent years, inspired by work in data-driven face psychophysics by Rachael Jack (University of Glasgow), Frederic Gosselin (University of Montreal) and others, our lab has developped a new research paradigm combining speech signal processing and psychophysical reverse-correlation ([PNAS 2018](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3972), [Nature Communications 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20649-4)). One focus of our team is to extend these approaches to not only reverse-correlate stimulus features on overt behavioural responses, but also on electrophysiological responses extracted from EEG, EMG and autonomic activity.

### History

The neuro team was established in the FEMTO-ST Institute in Jan. 2021. The team moved from its previous installment as the [CREAM music neuroscience team](http://cream.ircam.fr) at the [Science and Technology of Music and Sound Lab](https://www.stms-lab.fr/) (STMS, IRCAM/CNRS/Sorbonne Université) in [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/), Paris, France.
