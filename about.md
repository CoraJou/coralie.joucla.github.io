### About us

We're an interdisciplinary team of scientists exploring system modelling and control systems approaches to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology. This means our work is both experimental (we collect our own data, using tools borrowed from the fields of [neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neurophysiology) and [psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics)) and computational (we build our own techniques to e.g. generate experimental stimuli using [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) or analyse physiological recordings using data-driven [system modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification)), with a strong focus on clinical applications in [neurological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology) and [psychiatrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry) pathologies such as coma, stroke, autism spectrum and post-traumatic stress disorders. 

We're based in the [Department of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation), in the [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) (CNRS/Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté) in Besançon, France. 

### Research

### History

The neuro team was established in the FEMTO-ST Institute in Jan. 2021. The team moved from it previous installment as the [CREAM music neuroscience team](http://cream.ircam.fr/) at the [Science and Technology of Music and Sound Lab](https://www.stms-lab.fr/) (STMS, IRCAM/CNRS/Sorbonne Université) in [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/), Paris, France.
