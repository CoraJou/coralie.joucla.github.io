### Recent advances in auditory reverse correlation

On the occasion of the PhD Defense of Aynaz Adl Zarrabi, the FEMTO Neuro group has hosted a mini-workshop on recent avances in auditory reverse correlation on Wed. July 9th, 2025, in Besançon, France. 

Reverse correlation is a family of experimental and analytical methods in human psychophysics which takes inspiration from Wiener/Volterra theories of system identification. While reverse correlation has a long and prestigious history in [neurophysiology](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1733728) and [psychophysics](https://hal.science/hal-05060148v1/file/LeBagousse_Varnet_CFA_2025.pdf), its relatively recent application to high-level auditory tasks such as music or language perception has lead to a burgeoning research community - with France as one of its local epicenters.  

Following a number of similar previous events organized in [Paris (2018)](https://cream.ircam.fr/?p=596) and [Ghent (2024)](https://escan2024.com/planned-tutorials-and-symposia/), this mini-workshop brings together 4 early-career CNRS PIs from Paris, Aix and Marseille for a morningful of recent advances in auditory reverse correlation.
