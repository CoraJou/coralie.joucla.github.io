I have a Master's degree from the [École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques (ENSMM)](https://www.supmicrotech.fr/en) in Engineer science. I made my last master internship in Neuro group on a closed-loop system to control the pitch of human voice. To be a closed-loop system, it needed to measure the pitch and then to modify the resulting pitch, all this in few milliseconds to not perturb the sensory-motor human feedback system. <br>
Now i work as a research engineer to do even more signal processing on voice recording but also on photoplethysmograph (PPG) data, cleaning and preparing subject recordings as databases or stimuli, or even doing some Linear Mixed-effect Modeling (LMM) to analyse some side effects during projects. I'm continuing to deepen my skills and discovering new aspects of research while preparing myself for an eventual PhD position for the future.
