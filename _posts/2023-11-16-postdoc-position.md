### Postdoc position: Parametric texture generation and manufacturing at the micro-nano-meter scale for tactile psychophysics

*Application deadline:* Feb. 29th, 2024 <br>
*Start date:* March-May, 2024<br> 

The [Femto Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io) and the [Mecanochemistry and Tribology](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/APPLIED-MECHANICS/Research-groups/ECTO-team) team, [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) in Besançon, France are seeking applications for a Postdoctoral position (1 year, with a possible 1-year extension) at the intersection of the three domains of computer graphics/applied maths, material science/micro-nano manufacturing and psychophysics/haptics research.  The position will be based in Besançon, France. 

The position is funded by CNRS, with the generous support of [Région Bourgogne Franche-Comté](https://www.bourgognefranchecomte.fr/) (Project ASPECT - Automatique des systèmes perceptifs) and [EIPHI Graduate School](https://gradschool.eiphi.ubfc.fr/) (Project STARTREC - Studying the tactile perception of textures through reverse correlation).

#### The science

Tactile perception results from the activation of populations of skin mecanoreceptors which respond selectively to the mechanical forces and vibrations induced by friction when the finger explores a spatial texture, with spatial sensitivity down to the nanometer scale ([Skedung et al. Scientific Reports 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02617)). The response of mechanoreceptors is then propagated to the central nervous system, and processed to create percepts of whether the surface is e.g. soft, rough, slick or sticky ([McGlone, Wessberg, & Olausson, Neuron 2014](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0896-6273%2814%2900387-0)).  

Contrary to vision or hearing for which clear psychophysical links have been established between the physical properties of a stimulus and their psychological correlates, the sense of touch remains poorly understood. This is partly owing to the fact that, contrary to sound and image stimuli which can be synthesized algorithmically with advanced parametric control (see e.g. [Arias et al. Emotion Review 2021](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/articles/2020/Arias_Emotion_Review_2020.pdf) for voice; [Yu et al. Multimedia Tools and Applications 2015](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29587621.pdf) for faces), generating surface samples for psychophysics research at the appropriate scale and level of spatial complexity remains remarkably challenging. Existing studies have either used textures that have the appropriate (nm-μm) scale but can only be manufactured with limited spatial complexity (e.g. strain-induced wrinkles in PDMS; [Skedung et al. Scientific Reports 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02617)) or textures that have complex parametric statistics but can only be manufactured at the macroscopic scale ([Sahi et al. Scientific Reports 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72890-y)).

(a) Surface wrinkling of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), formed spontaneously upon applying a mechanical stress to a bilayer system where the top layer has a higher elastic modulus. Wrinkle wavelengths range from 300 nm to 90 μm and amplitudes between 7 nm and 4.5 μm; [Skedung et al. Scientific Reports 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02617). (b) 50 square-mm surfaces with random roughness, printed by polygraphic printing in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) at the 0.1-1mm scale; [Sahi et al. Scientific Reports 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72890-y) </sub>.

The goal of this postdoctoral project is to bridge this gap and to design and manufacture surfaces with complex parametric textures using state-of-art micro-nano-scale fabrication techniques. The project lies at the interface between applied maths/computer modeling, material science/micro-fabrication and psychophysics. 

At the modeling level, the postdoctoral fellow will investigate novel algorithms to generate stochastic surface topographies using statistical parameters that are compatible with both the constraints of tactile physiology (i.e. patterns that can be perceived) and micro-fabrication techniques (i.e. patterns that can be manufactured). This can take inspiration from modeling work in the domain of auditory texture synthesis ([McDermott & Simoncelli, Neuron 2011](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(11)00562-9.pdf)) or procedural terrain generation in computer graphics ([Ebert et al. 2002](https://books.google.fr/books?id=F4t-5zSsqr4C))

(b) Two-dimensional slice through 3D "Perlin" gradient noise, generated with [https://github.com/blackears/PerlinNoiseMaker](https://github.com/blackears/PerlinNoiseMaker)

For micromanufacturing, the project builds on the availability of the [MIMENTO technology center](https://platforms.femto-st.fr/centrale-technologie-mimento), a major national-scale resource for micro-fabrication and nanotechnologies. Co-located with the FEMTO-ST Institute in Besançon, the MIMENTO platform offers more than 800 sq-meter of clean room and more than 20M€ state-of-art equipment in lithography and 3D laser microfabrication. Of particular interest for the project, the postdoctoral fellow will be able to explore femtosecond laser-based micromachining processes in photosensitive polymers ([Nanoscribe](https://lims.femto-st.fr/WebForms/Equipment/EquipmentView.aspx?toolId=72)) and in hard glass-type materials ([FEMTOprint](https://lims.femto-st.fr/WebForms/Equipment/EquipmentView.aspx?toolId=63)). 

<img class='img-responsive center-block' src="/images/post/position/tactile2.png" width="100%" />

Finally, the fabricated surfaces will be tested as material for psychophysical experiments on tactile perception, using the paradigm of reverse correlation (e.g. [Ponsot et al. PNAS 2018](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3972)) with simultaneous measurements of contact forces and friction-induced vibrations, made with custom tribometers. For this, the postdoctoral fellow will be able to access the facilities and equipment of the [Femto Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io) (for human participant research) and the [ECTO](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/APPLIED-MECHANICS/Research-groups/ECTO-team) team (for tribology experiments). 

<img class='img-responsive center-block' src="/images/post/position/tactile1.jpg" width="70%" />

All in one, this project presents an exciting mix of science and technology, both computational and material, all in the aim to tackle a fundamental question about tactile perception with wide ranging applications, from e.g. surface conception for product design to the assessment of pathologies of tactile perception.

#### Applicants

The ideal applicant for this position holds a PhD with a background either in computer modeling and applied maths (with an appetite for material science and micro-fabrication), or in material science and microfabrication (with an appetite for computer modeling and applied maths). 

The project offers the best training potential for applicants who already have a solid programming background in Python or Matlab. 

Experience with 3D laser microfabrication and/or lithography at the micro-scale will be considered an asset, but is not a requirement (as the MIMENTO facilities offers ad-hoc technical training for these technologies). Similarly, experience with tactile perception research or psychophysics in general will be considered an asset, but is not a requirement.
