### Faculty position (junior professorship): Machine-learning for the data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems 

*Application deadline:* 02 June 2025 (4pm, CET) <br>
*Start date:* Sept. 2025<br> 

[SUPMICROTECH](https://www.supmicrotech.fr/) (École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques) and the Dept of Automation and Robotics, [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) in Besançon, France are advertising an exciting new faculty position on the topic of Scientific machine learning (_machine learning for the data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems_), with possible application (but not limited) to the scope of the [Neuro research group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io). 

The position is a junior professorship ("chaire de professeur junior"), a new type of position intended as a priviledged fast-track to a Full Professorship position ("professeur des universités"). It consists of an initial fixed-term period leading (3-5 years depending on experience) leading, upon successful review, to direct promotion at the rank of Full Professor. This is a primarily research-oriented position, with a reduced teaching load of 64 hours (96 HETD) per year (equivalent to two one-semester courses). Upon successful review at the end of the tenure period, the position will be turned into a permanent/tenured full professor position in the French university system with the standard teaching load of 128 hours (192 HETD, or four one-semester courses) per year. The initial monthly gross salary will be around 3500 Euros (depending on experience), and include a generous 320k€ research startup package (tentatively: funding for 2 PhD students and one postdoc). 

The position is opened for applications from May 2nd to June 2nd, 2025, with a start date in the 2025-2026 academic year (Sept. 2025). Applications should be made solely via the national Odyssée portal at [https://odyssee.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/](https://odyssee.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/) - see application information below. Before submitting their application, we strongly encourage applicants to make contact with the FEMTO AS2M and SUPMICROTECH research teams in order to adapt their research and teaching statements to the strategic directions of the two institutions: see contact information below.

#### Research profile

The recruited faculty is expected to join the [Dept of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation) (Automatique et Systèmes Micromécatroniques, AS2M) of the [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr), of which SUPMICROTECH is one of the host operating institutions.

The aim of this faculty position is to set up a research program around the theme of explainable and physically-informed AI for modeling dynamical systems, and to steer a strong and original vision for the place of AI both in the research of the AS2M Dept, and in the SUPMICROTECH teaching curriculum. The new faculty is expected to develop a research agenda towards inventing the next generation of scientific machine-learning tools for controlling complex physical or physiological systems, by using a *data-driven approach to discover physically interpretable models of dynamical systems based on temporal data* (instead of studying such systems analytically). 

Machine learning for the data-driven estimation of dynamical systems is a strongly emerging field in machine-learning (see, for example, the recent [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington in Seattle, the [L4DC](https://l4dc.web.ox.ac.uk/home) cycle of international conferences, or the [AI for Science](https://aissai.cnrs.fr/) Center at CNRS). Relevant to this field are recently introduced methologies such as symbolic regression methods (SINDY; [Brunton et al. 2016](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1517384113)), operator learning ([Boullé et Townsend, 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14688)), surrogate systems ([Durstewitz, Koppe & Thurm, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00740-7)) or physics-informed neural networks ([Karniadakis et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00314-5)). 

[Research conducted within the AS2M department](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation) is based on a multi-disciplinary foundation combining mechatronics, automation and data science. Applications of machine learning for dynamical systems is central to the Department's recent work, whether in the control of [innovative robotic architectures](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Research-groups/ROMOCO) (e.g. flexible and dexterous robotics), the modeling of [unconventional physical systems at micro/nanometric scales](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Research-groups/ROBIMSS) (e.g. machine-cell interaction) or the [prediction of complex dynamical systems in the fields of industrial, environment or health monitoring](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Research-groups/DATA-PHM) (e.g. identifying dynamical systems from neurobiological data). 

At AS2M, the new faculty's research agenda is expected to foster new cross-disciplinary projects combining, for example, modeling and control, or control and prediction, and may in particular capitalize on the department's strong momentum in the field of micro/healthcare technologies, with applications at the level of the cell (e.g. cell characterization), organ (e.g. sensors for oncology diagnostics), or organism (e.g. neurosciences). Notably, if concerned with neuroscience, the new faculty's research agenda will benefit from an extensive in-house facility for healthy-participant EEG recording, as well as an ongoing partnership with the GHU Paris Hospital for intracranial and clinical EEG data collection in patients ([https://neuro-team-femto.github.io](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io)).

#### Teaching profile

The recruited person will be part of the SUPMICROTECH computer science teaching department and contribute to training the school's [engineering curriculum](https://www.supmicrotech.fr/en/organisation-and-content-after-ccp-or-l3) by strengthening the link between training and research. 

The faculty is expected to contribute to the "artificial intelligence for engineers" theme and participate to the strategic overhaul of SUPMICROTECH's teaching curriculum in digital/data-science and AI for industry. They will develop AI teaching focused on explainability, physically-informed AI and scientific machine-learning, in interaction with the micro-mechatronic, microrobotic and biological systems or biological systems studied at the School, with a focus on the physical meaning of the models and/or their use in control or prediction frameworks.

The teaching load during the tenure-track period is 64 hours (96 HETD) per year (equivalent to two one-semester courses). Upon successful review at the end of the tenure period, the position will be turned into a permanent/tenured full professor position in the French university system with the standard teaching load of 128 hours (192 HETD, or four one-semester courses) per year.
