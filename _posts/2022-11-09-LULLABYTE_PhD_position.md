### PhD position: Cracking the code of auditory perception during sleep using modern closed-loop engineering methods (Lullabyte project). 

*Application deadline:* March 31st, 2023 <br>
*Start date:* Sept 1st, 2023<br> 
*Important eligibiliy notice:* Candidates must not have resided in France for more than 12 months between Sept. 2020 and Sept. 2023. 



The [Femto Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io), [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) in Besançon, France and the [Cognitive Biopsychology and Methods lab](https://www.unifr.ch/psycho/en/research/biopsy/), University of Fribourg, Switzerland, are seeking applications for a fully-funded PhD position (3 years) about the application of closed-loop control engineering techniques to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology data during sleep. The position will be based primarily in Besançon, France, and include a research stay in Fribourg, Switzerland. 

The position is funded by CNRS, with the generous support of the [LULLABYTE](https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-music-21659) Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network.

#### The science

While the sleeping brain was once believed to be isolated from external sensory events, a series of findings have demonstrated the surprising extend to which it in fact continues to process external sounds: sleepers can e.g. differentiate meaningful speech vs irrelevant signals (Legendre et al. 2019), recognize the sound their own name (Perrin et al. 1999), process sounds as memory cues to improve subsequent recall of information (Rudoy et al. 2009), and even rehearse the performance of music melodies (Antony et al. 2012). Despite this flurry of findings, little is still understood about what types of sounds are favored for transmission to the cortex during sleep, notably because current research exploring the optimal acoustic characteristics of, e.g., fire alarms do so with highly inefficient experimental paradigms (testing 2-3 sounds per night, waking up participants many times), which strongly limit scientific progress.

Following detection of a slow-oscillation (SO) down-state in the sleep EEG signal, pulses of pink noise are delivered in phase with the two subsequent SOs.

For the past 15 years, the field of sleep and cognition has increasingly relied on real-time, closed-loop auditory stimulation techniques, that are able to trigger sound stimuli in a synchronized manner with specific brain oscillations, typically slow oscillations (SOs) and, to a lesser extent, sleep spindles (for a recent review, see Ngo, Antony & Rasch, 2022). While these techniques are principally used to study the effect of stimulating specific oscillatory patterns and increase e.g. memory consolidation (Ngo et al. 2013), they open avenues for innovations based on modern control engineering techniques such as closed-loop system identification and feedback control. These techniques would be able not only to trigger fixed stimuli in phase with fixed EEG events (Ferster, Lustenberger & Karlen, 2019), but also to automatically adapt the sonic content of such stimuli, to characterize the transfer function between sound and EEG, and to discover new neurophysiological mechanisms to interact with the real-time sleeping brain. 

This PhD project, which is a collaboration between a control engineering lab in Besançon (France) and a sleep cognition research lab in Fribourg (Switzerland), therefore aims to explore the application of modern closed-loop control engineering to the exciting field of sleep auditory stimulation.

#### The environment

![Besancon](/images/post/position/besancon2.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-top: 7px;" width="30%"} The successful applicant will join the [FEMTO Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/), a small, recently-established interdisciplinary group of scientists (currently 2 PIs, one postdoc, two PhD students) exploring control-systems approaches to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology in health and disease. The Femto neuro group is part of the larger *System Data Science* team, a concentration of 7 faculty working on data-driven analysis, pronostic and health management of natural, industrial and environmental systems (head: Prof. [Jean-Marc Nicod](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/femto-people/jmnicod)), and based in the [Department of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation), [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) in Besançon, France. 

Work in the Neuro group is both experimental (we collect our own EEG and behavioural data) and computational (we build our own software methods), with a strong focus on clinical applications (see our recent work [here](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/about)). The group also has a strong focus on open science, and develops and maintains a number of free, open-source [research software](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/resources/) which are made available for the research community. In Besançon, the PhD candidate will be supervised by Dr [Jean-Julien Aucouturier](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/people/jj_aucouturier/) (Directeur de recherche CNRS). 


![Fribourg](/images/post/position/fribourg.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-top: 7px;" width="30%"} This project also includes a research secondments at the [Cognitive Biopsychology and Methods lab](https://www.unifr.ch/psycho/en/research/biopsy/), Dept of Psychology, [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/psycho/fr/),  Switzerland, where the PhD application will be co-supervised by Prof. [Björn Rasch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A1105okAAAAJ&hl=de). It is anticipated that system development and awake EEG will be developped in Besançon, and sleep EEG data will recorded in Fribourg.

#### Applicants

The ideal applicant for this position holds a Master of Science with a background either in computational modeling (e.g., control engineering, physiological system modeling, computer science) and an interest in neuroscience, or in experimental psychology/neuroscience with a strong interest in computational methods (e.g., computational neuroscience, psychophysical data modeling). The position would be also suitable for a M.D. in Neurology/Sleep Medicine, with an appetite for computational methods. The project offers the best training potential for applicants who already have experience analysing awake/sleep EEG data, and have a solid programming background in Python, R or Matlab. 

<b>Important notice:</b> because the position is funded by a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks), there are strict mobility rules of eligibility for this position. <b> Applicants must not have resided </b> or carried out their main activity (work, studies etc.) <b> in France for more than 12 months in the last 36 months </b> before the date of recruitment, i.e. between Sept. 2020 and Sept. 2023.
