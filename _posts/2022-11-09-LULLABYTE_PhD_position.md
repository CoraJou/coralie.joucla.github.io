### PhD position: Cracking the code of auditory perception during sleep using data-driven methods (Lullabyte project). 

*Application deadline:* March 31st, 2023 <br>
*Start date:* Sept 1st, 2023<br> 

The [Femto Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io) is anticipating the opening of a fully-funded PhD position (3 years), to be held in the _System Data Science_ group, [Departement of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation), [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) in Besançon, France, about the application of data-driven techniques inspired by control engineering to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology data during sleep. 

The position is funded by CNRS, with the generous support of the [LULLABYTE](https://twitter.com/LullabyteDN) Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network. 

Preliminary details about the position are given below. Watch this space for full details about the project and how to apply from Jan. 2023 onwards.

#### The science

Almost nothing is known about what types of sound are favored for transmission to the cortex during sleep, and current research exploring the optimal acoustic characteristics of, e.g., fire alarms do so with highly inefficient experimental paradigms (testing 2-3 sounds per night, waking up participants many times), which strongly limit scientific progress. 

In this project, the PhD fellow will investigate the use of modern data-driven techniques inspired by control engineering (such as reverse-correlation, temporal response functions and feedback system control) to analyse participants’ covert sensory electrophysiological responses to continuous streams of sounds, without interrupting their sleep.

#### The environment

The successful applicant will join the [FEMTO Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/), a small, recently-established interdisciplinary group of scientists (currently 2 PIs, one postdoc, two PhD students) exploring control-systems approaches to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology. The Femto neuro group is part of the larger *System Data Science* team, a concentration of 7 faculty working on data-driven analysis, pronostic and health management of natural, industrial and environmental systems (head: Prof. [Jean-Marc Nicod](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/femto-people/jmnicod)), and based in the [Department of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation), [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr) in Besançon, France. 

Work in the Neuro group is both experimental (we collect our own EEG and behavioural data) and computational (we build our own software methods), with a strong focus on clinical applications (see our recent work [here](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/about)). The group also has a strong focus on open science, and develops and maintains a number of free, open-source [research software](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/resources/) which are made available for the research community. 

In Besançon, the PhD candidate will be supervised by Dr [Jean-Julien Aucouturier](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/people/jj_aucouturier/) (Directeur de recherche CNRS). This project also includes secondments with Björn Rasch (Université de Fribourg, Switzerland) for the recording of sleep EEG and Tarek Sharshar (GHU Paris Psychiatry & Neurosciences, Paris, France), for clinical applications to patients with disorders of consciousness (coma).

#### Applicants

The ideal applicant for this position holds a Master of Science with a background either in computational modeling (e.g., control engineering, physiological system modeling, computer science) with an interest in neuroscience, or in experimental psychology/neuroscience with an interest in computational methods (e.g., computational neuroscience, psychophysical data modeling). The position would be also suitable for a M.D. in Neurology/Sleep Medicine, with an appetite for computational methods. The project offers the best training potential for applicants who already have experience analysing awake/sleep EEG data, and have a solid programming background in Python, R or Matlab. Applicants must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies etc.) in France for more than 12 months in the last 36 months before the date of recruitment.
