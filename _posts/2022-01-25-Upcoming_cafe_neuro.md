As of Nov. 2023, every Wednesday morning (10am-11am CET), we get together (mix of virtual and in-person) for coffee, cake and a short talk. 

On a rotating basis, each member of the lab gives a small project update: what they've been working on in the past 1-2 months, what their current data and results are, what pending questions they may have. 

The style is informal, the content work-in-progress, and the goal is to get everybody's feedback, to keep everyone up-to-date about what each other is doing and to encourage cross-talk - ideally, each talk should be the basis for a further conversation between the speaker and at least one other lab member who may have something concrete to contribute (ideas, code, paper) to their project.  

For the record, in previous installments of café neuro (2021-2022), we used a slightly different format inspired by Kording lab's ["Lab Teachings"](http://kordinglab.com/2021/01/01/upcoming-lab-teaching.html), where each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know. Click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/11/09/Archive_cafe_neuro.html) for archives of previous topics. However, as the lab grew in size, we felt the need to absolutely keep the coffee and cake (!), but use a more traditional 'project update' format.  

Speakers are listed here for the upcoming terms.
