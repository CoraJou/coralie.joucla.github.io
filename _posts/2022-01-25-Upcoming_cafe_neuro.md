Every Thursdays (13:30-14:30), we get together (mix of virtual and in-person) for coffee, cake and a short talk, in a format inspired by Kording lab's ["Lab Teachings"](http://kordinglab.com/2021/01/01/upcoming-lab-teaching.html). 

On a rotating basis, each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know. Anything, really. Relevant and interesting topics, good skills to know, nice Python packages, an interesting paper they read and want to share... whatever! 

As of Nov. 2022, we organize cafés on a 2-month cycle (8 sessions), with an initial session devoted to topic planning for the remaining 7 sessions. Additionally, one session every cycle (typically, the 4th) is set aside for a "topic-free" team meeting to discuss items related to lab life (purchases, travel, etc.), with an agenda that's assembled collectively at the beginning of the session. 

<br style="clear:both" />
We try to keep this informal, so our rule of thumb is "one hour - one hour": if you're a speaker, don't spend more than one hour preparing it (possibly recycling existing material that you've taught or talked about elsewhere); and we try to keep the session within one single hour, so everyone can plan the rest of their afternoon. 

Topics are listed here for the upcoming terms. Click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/11/09/Archive_cafe_neuro.html) for archives of previous café neuro.
