### Learning & Dynamics Seminar Series

Together with our FEMTO colleague [Prof. John Dudley](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/femto-people/johndudley), Professor of Optical Physics, the [FEMTO Neuro group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/) is putting together a monthy series of invited seminars on the topic of machine learning for dynamical systems. 

The "Learning & Dynamics" Seminar Series wishes to address - roughly defined - *how one may analyse & discover physically-interpretable models of dynamical systems on the basis of observed temporal data, rather than attempt to study them in a purely analytical manner*. Our seminar aims to address interdisciplinary applications across complex physical or physiological systems, such as neuroscience, non-linear optics or fluid mechanics.

For our inaugural 2024-2025 series, we have assembled a program with a fantastic list of early-career EU researchers who have made recent notable contributions to this emerging field. As a kick-off event on Tuesday 17th 2024, we are also honored to host an invited talk by [Prof. J. Nathan Kutz](http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/), Director of the NSF [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington, USA.

#### Time & Place

L&D seminars are held in-person, monthly (typically the 3rd Thursday of the month, 2pm), and alternate every other month between 2 locations in the FEMTO premises in Besançon, France (Amphithéatre *Jean-Jacques Gagnepain*, [FEMTO TEMIS Building, 15B avenue des Montboucons](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zt9eBHZ1CmZDoJnB6) & Amphithéatre *Jules Haag*, [FEMTO SUPMICROTECH Building, 26 rue de l'Epitaphe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuZa8Ztsu8GmXg1y7)). 

Attendance is free, in the limit of available seats (no reservation taken). For non-FEMTO personnel, please be prepared to identify yourself with a mandatory ID document at the entrance counter in each location.
